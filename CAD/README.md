# Some notes about the case
  * Some kind of strapping system to attach to bike frame
  * Make the case slightly parametric to adapt to angles / dimensions of different bike frames
  * Case needs to be at least splash - waterproof
    * That means some kind of gasket / o-ring between the half shells
  * Waterproof PCB connectors? Never saw such a thing
    * AC input
    * DC out (to front light)
    * DC out (to back light)
    * Maybe just one DC out and split externally
  * Model the whole thing in Fusion360? Is there an open source alternative?
